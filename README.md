# Installation

This is a playground for your first steps in testing, so instead of installing it from NPM it is recommended to clone it from repo instead and then install the dependencies:

```
git clone git@github.com:codecept-js/examples.git codeceptjs-examples && cd codeceptjs-examples && npm install
```

This will install CodeceptJS with Puppeteer, WebdriverIO & TestCafe packages. 

# Running Tests

## Playwright

Use `codecept.conf.js` to run tests with Playwright:

```
npx codeceptjs run --steps -c codecept.puppeteer.conf.js 
```

```

## TestCafe
